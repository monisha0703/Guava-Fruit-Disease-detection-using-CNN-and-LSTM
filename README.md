 Guava-Fruit-Disease-detection-using-CNN-and-LSTM
 
This project focuses on detecting guava fruit diseases using a hybrid deep learning model that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. CNNs are used to extract spatial features from guava fruit images, identifying patterns and textures associated with various diseases, while LSTMs help capture sequential dependencies and enhance classification accuracy. The model is trained on a diverse dataset of guava fruit images categorized into multiple disease classes, including canker, scab, rust, and more. With a user-friendly interface and high prediction accuracy, this system aims to support farmers and agricultural experts in early disease detection, leading to better crop management and yield.

Diseases Types Founded:

-> Canker

-> Disease Free

-> Dot

->Mummification

->Phytophthora

->RedRust

->Rust

->Scab

->Styler & Root

Libraries

->TensorFlow and Keras for deep learning model operations

->NumPy for numerical computations

->OpenCV (cv2) for image capture and processing

->Pillow (PIL) for image manipulation

->Tkinter and ImageTk for building the graphical user interface, along with os, time, threading, and future for system operations, timing, concurrency, and compatibility across Python versions.
